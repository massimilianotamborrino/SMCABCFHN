\arguments{
\item{data}{observed data}

\item{extra}{Any additional coefficients/vector of coefficients which may be need to simulate from the model}

\item{extra_summaries}{Any additional coefficients/vector needed to compute the summaries}

\item{parmask}{set of 0/1 to see which parameters have to be estimated}

\item{ABCthreshold}{Initial value for the threshold for the guided approach}

\item{number_sim}{Total number of simulations, after which we stop the algorithm}

\item{summ_weights}{vector with weights of the summaries computed from a pilot study}

\item{numparticles}{number of particles to keep}

\item{alpha}{percentile to compute the ABC threshold out of all distances}

\item{sampling}{specify the chosen samplers. The options are standard or olcm}

\item{attempt}{number of iteration}

\item{folder}{specify the folder where the results are going to be saved in}

\item{we}{weights to scale the model-based summaries}

\item{whichsummarymodelbased}{specify whether to consider IAEspectrum, IAE density, Wass density, Wass spectrum}

\item{whichprior}{1 for uniform, 2 for lognormal priors}

\item{subsamplingby}{every how many simulated points the observation should be taken. The default=1, i.e., no subsampling}
