\usage{
problemprior(theta, draw, whichprior = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{theta}{Parameter Vector;}

\item{draw}{Draw=0 if we want to compute the product of the pdfs of the priors
Draw =1 if we want to sample from the priors}

\item{whichprior}{1 uniform, 2 lognormal}
}
\value{
Simulation of observations from all models (for draw=1) or pdf of the priors (for draw=0), returned as vector;
}
\description{
Either pdf of priors (for draw=0) or sample from the prior (for draw =1)
}
